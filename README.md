Hotel Room Booking Management Application
As part of my software development journey, I built a comprehensive Hotel Management Application inspired by Tim Coreyâ€™s tutorial. This project allowed me to apply my skills in C#, ASP.NET, and SQL Server and WPF creating a robust solution for managing hotel operations.

Key Features:
Reservation System: Users can make room reservations, check availability, and view booking details using Web user interface.
Guest Management: Staff can use the Desktop application built using WPF to track guest information, including check-in/check-out dates.

Technologies Used:
C#: The backbone of the application, powering the business logic and data processing.
ASP.NET: I leveraged ASP.NET for building the web interface, ensuring a seamless user experience.
SQL Server: The database stores guest records, reservations, and financial data.
Visual Studio: My IDE of choice for development and debugging.
WPF: Built a desktop application for staff with real time data synchronization with the web application.

Achievements:
Successfully deployed the application on a local server, allowing hotel staff to use it in their day-to-day operations.

Future Enhancements:
In the future, I plan to extend the application by adding features like:
Room Inventory: I implemented a room inventory system, allowing staff to manage room types, rates, and availability.
Billing and Invoicing: The app generates invoices, calculates charges, and handles payments.
